# How to contribute
The coach will continue to evolve thanks to people who contributes, so please help us make it better!

## Submitting pull requests
If you want help out, that's great! Before taking the time to code something, feel free to open an issue first proposing your idea to other contributors, that way you can get feedback on the idea before taking time to write precious code.

For any new functionality we like to see unit tests added as well so that we can catch regressions in the future in case something else breaks your fix.

## Add a defect
Please make sure you use the [latest version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webcoach) of the coach. Then check the [defect/bug list](https://github.com/sitespeedio/coach/issues?labels=bug&page=1&state=open) to make sure that it hasn't been filed yet.

The goal is that the coach should work in the latest Chrome & Firefox. Please only file bugs for those browsers.

If you find a defect, please file a bug report that we can reproduce.

## Add a change request/new functionality request
If you have an idea or something that you need the coach to handle, add an issue and lets discuss it there. Ideas/changes/requests are very very welcome!

Thanks for your time & support!

Peter & Tobias
